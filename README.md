# API Intro

## Objectives

- Explain what an API is
- Use fetch to GET data from an external API
- Append data from a fetch request to the DOM

- Stretch: Identify API's you would like to use!

## Notes
API = Application Programming Interface
-Internal API(things that are perhaps native to a language)
    -Fetch - the new way to handle AJAX request
    -AJAX- asynchronous javascript and XML
-External API is usually a server in a database that exists somewhere else(some person/collection fo people who have gathered information; some you have to have a key or pay for)
    -server and database
    -we can request data from teh server
        -server queries database
    -server packages data and sends it to us
    -when you make a request, the api will send you a json
